To-Do List App
Overview
A simple To-Do List app in Flutter using Dart. Tasks are stored in a ToDo class with a description and a Boolean status. Completed tasks show a checkmark, while pending tasks show a cross icon.

Implementation
Tasks are displayed in a Column, with each task inside a row.
The task text and status icon are aligned properly using cross-axis alignment.
The list items are printed using a loop to dynamically generate the task entries.
Currently, tasks are hardcoded.
